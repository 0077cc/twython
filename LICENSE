Tango is released under the "Tango License".

What's the "Tango License"? It basically means you can do
whatever you want with this; hack on it, redistribute it, contribute changes, whatever.

All I ask is that, if you do make changes to Tango, decide to fork it, etc., please provide some
note about the origin of the work. (i.e, a link back to Tango, etc)

Tango is provided "as-is"; that is, I don't guarantee that it will 100% work in your
environment without some effort. Tango is a base to build off of.
